# Backend Requirements for Map Features

## 1. Live Location and Routing

*   **User Live Location:**
    *   An endpoint to receive and store the user's live GPS coordinates.
    *   This will likely involve using WebSockets for real-time updates.
*   **Destination and Routing:**
    *   An endpoint that accepts a start location (user's live location) and a destination location (e.g., coordinates or a place ID).
    *   This endpoint should return a route, which is a series of coordinates that can be drawn as a polyline on the map.
    *   This will require integration with a routing service like Google Maps Directions API, Mapbox Directions API, or an open-source solution like OSRM.

## 2. Crowd Density Data

*   **Crowd Data Endpoint:**
    *   An endpoint to provide crowd density data for various locations.
    *   The data for each location should include:
        *   Location ID or name.
        *   GPS coordinates.
        *   Crowd count (an estimated number of people).
        *   Crowd level (e.g., "low", "medium", "high") or a numerical value that can be mapped to colors (green, orange, red) on the frontend.
*   **Data Source:**
    *   The backend will need a data source for crowd information. This could be from CCTV cameras with people-counting algorithms, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth beacon tracking, or other sensor data.
